Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Game Development

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain deep insights into the data related to game development. The primary objective was to understand various aspects of the game data and identify key patterns and trends that could inform future game development efforts.

Key steps in this analysis included:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensured the dataset was clean and ready for analysis by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculated basic statistics to understand the central tendencies, distributions, and variances within the data.

Visualizations:

Bar Charts : To display the distribution of distribution of different ranks.
Donut Charts: To investigate relationships between different numerical variables.
Heatmaps: To visualize correlations between variables.
Feature Analysis: Analyzed various features to determine their impact on
game performance and player engagement.
By conducting this EDA, I was able to uncover valuable insights that can guide game development strategies, enhance player experience, and optimize game performance.
